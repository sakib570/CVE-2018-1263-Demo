## Description of CVE

This exploit is related to an issue which was discovered in phpMyAdmin version 4.8.x before 4.8.2. By exploiting the issue an attacker can perform remote code execution and local file inclusion on the server. The vulnerability is due to the portion of the code which is responsible for redirecting and loading pages within phpMyAdmin. The code has a faulty test for whitelisted pages which makes the attack possible.  An attacker must be authenticated, except in the "$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] = true" case (where an attacker can specify any host he/she is already in control of, and execute arbitrary code on phpMyAdmin) and the "$cfg['ServerDefault'] = 0" case (which bypasses the login requirement and runs the vulnerable code without any authentication).

## Why does the vulnerability exist

## How to install vulnerable component
The exploit infrastructure requires vulnerable version of phpMyAdmin and mysql. We will use docker containers to install the required components. For vulnerable version of phpMyAdmin we will use prebuilt docker environnement from [Vulhub](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub) and for mysql we will use latest official version from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/). The installation script is provided as a docker compose yml script which can be found in the repository. 

We assume that the intended machine has **docker** and **docker-compose** installed. If not then please refer to the docker [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install them. Once installed perform the following steps to setup the vulnerable component:

First clone the repository in your intended machine and navigate to the cloned directory
```
git clone git@gits-15.sys.kth.se:msnkhan/exploit-demo.git
cd exploit-demo
```
Then run the docker compose script using the following command
```
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
Once installation process is finished docker will expose phpMyAdmin page on port **8080** of your machine. You can check by opening the page in your browser using the follwoing address format
```
http://your-machine-ip:8080
```
If the installation process is successful you should see a page like the following
